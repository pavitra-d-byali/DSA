    "# Longest Consecutive Sequence — Short Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. Key Insight\n",
    "A number is the **start** of a consecutive sequence *only if*:\n",
    "\n",
    "(num - 1) is NOT in the set\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This guarantees each sequence is counted exactly once, avoiding redundant scans.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. Algorithm (O(n))\n",
    "1. Insert all numbers into an `unordered_set` for O(1) lookups.  \n",
    "2. For each number:\n",
    "   - If `(num - 1)` is not present → this is the start of a sequence.\n",
    "   - Count upward:\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "     num, num+1, num+2, ...\n",
    "     ```\n",
    "   - Track the longest streak length.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. Why This Is O(n)\n",
    "Each number is involved at most twice:\n",
    "- Once when checking if it’s a sequence start  \n",
    "- Once when counted inside a streak  \n",
    "\n",
    "No sorting and no nested brute-force loops.\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. One-Line Summary\n",
    "Find all true starting points and expand the sequence until it breaks.\n",
    "\n",
    "## C++ Implementation\n",
    "```cpp\n",
    "class Solution {\n",

    "\n",
    "        for (int num : s) {\n",
    "            // Start a sequence only if (num - 1) doesn't exist\n",
    "            if (s.find(num - 1) == s.end()) {\n",
