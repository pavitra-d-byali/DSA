# DSA
s the array sorted?
→ Use Binary Search, Two Pointers, or Prefix Sums

2. Optimization problems (Max/Min/Subarray)?
→ Think Sliding Window, Dynamic Programming, or Greedy

3. Looking for duplicates / counts / frequencies?
→ Use HashMap, HashSet, or Counting Array

4. Need substrings or fixed-size subarrays?
→ Apply Sliding Window with Two Pointers

5. Frequent min/max in window?
→ Use Monotonic Queue, Deque, or Heap

6. Generating subsets, permutations, combinations?
→ Use Backtracking

7. Matching / parsing characters?
→ Use Stack, especially for Balanced Parentheses, Infix/Postfix

Most people struggle with DSA because they think they have weak logic.
But mostly, it’s because their approach is completely wrong.

If you want to solve problems fast and with solid accuracy, you need to think in patterns.

Without patterns, you can solve every problem in an interview that you’ve seen once, but once you see a new problem, you will get stuck.
